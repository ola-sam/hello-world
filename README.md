# hello-world
This is my very first repository and I am doing this ryt now to learn about branch and commit.
My name is Ola and if that is hard to pronounce, you can call me Sam (Yes, that's my second name).
I started out as an Accountant. But my love for IT, Business, Numbers and continuous brain tasking made me switch career to Data analyst.
I Just completed my MBA program and I am currently enrolled on Udacity for Data Analyst Nanodegree.
So, enough talking, time to commit.
